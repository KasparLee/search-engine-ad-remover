#### NOTE: This extension is not being actively maintained.

Originally published to the [Mozilla add-ons catalog](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/searchengineadremover/) back in 2015 as a small personal project, it still works, however I have little time to maintain it now hence it will no longer be getting any regular updates or new features.

Please submit any bug reports as a new issues with the *bug* label.

Any PRs for new features/websites to be supported to be made to the develop branch.
