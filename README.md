# Search Engine Ad Remover

#### Popular extension for Firefox to remove adverts on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and more!

The Mozilla add-ons catalog (AMO) listing page can be found [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/searchengineadremover/).

#### NOTE: This extension is not being actively maintained.

Originally published to the Mozilla add-ons catalog back in 2015 as a small personal project, it still works, however I have little time to maintain it now hence it will no longer be getting any regular updates or new features.

Please submit any bug reports as a new issues with the *bug* label.

Any PRs for new features/websites to be supported to be made to the develop branch.
